### Currently:
Physical chemistry research for my thesis. My latest manuscript describes [the origin of the pH dependence of the emission of an aqueous quantum dot system](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b03619). (*Hitting a paywall? The full-text may be avialble [here](https://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/254795442),* via *ACS Articles on Request*)
I also contributed to ["An introduction to ratchets in chemistry and biology".](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7MH00062F)

### Previously:
Immunology clinical trials, aqueous quantum dot syntheses, [nanoparticle-protein interactions in biological environments](https://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/204231824), biomaterials for wastewater treatment, [protein-based gold nanoparticle syntheses](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7DT03275G), polymer synthesis for drug delivery, and antimicrobial compound synthesis.
