If you’re involved in science twitter at all, you may have noticed the #AAASmtg buzz last week. The [American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting](https://meetings.aaas.org/), with the theme of Science Transcending Boundaries, was held in Washington, DC from February 14–17, 2019. While I was not in attendance, I followed the impressive resources that were shared online through the #AAASmtg hashtag. I’ve highlighted some below:

+ (Guide) [Recommended Practices for Science Communication with Policymakers](https://www.american.edu/spa/scicomm/upload/Recommended-Practices-Booklet_V17-DIGITAL.pdf)
+ (Talk, by [Karl Broman](https://kbroman.org/)) [Collaborating reproducibly](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/rrcollab_aaas2019.pdf)
+ (Article) [Twitter bots play disproportionate role spreading misinformation](http://cnets.indiana.edu/blog/2018/11/20/twitter-bots-play-disproportionate-role-spreading-misinformation/)
+ (Thread) This [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/FlipTanedo/status/1097207990149627905) from the “Science Outreach Online” panel, which led me to #5
+ (Paper) [An Introduction to Social Media for Scientists](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001535)

Bonus: check out this [living resource document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11XiL6lk3eQCUDcPifnUearI-AIdvzRdSdGhj1xWmRQA/edit?usp=sharing) from a session titled “A Shared Vision: Overcoming Barriers for Scientists to Communicate and Engage.”

Social media allows meeting organizers and speakers to impact more than just the physical attendees — and I’m so very grateful for it.
