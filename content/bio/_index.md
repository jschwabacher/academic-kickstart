### Hi, I'm a scientist based in Chicago, IL.

I'm currently a Consultant with Beghou Consulting. I envision, plan, and carry out complex projects. With all projects, I apply a broad frame of reference while balancing what is doable with what is actually worth doing. This frequently involves collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing both primary and secondary sources of data to provide evidence-based insights. I have a passion for quickly learning new information and communicating my relevant findings to audiences of all backgrounds. In alignment with my scientific training, I remain open to new information and am willing to change my mind based on newly acquired evidence. My most recent projects centered around fundamental nanoscience research, science education/engagement, organizational change and professional development at Northwestern University in conjunction with the Center for Bioinspired Energy Science and the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning.

### Background.
My love of science education quietly revealed itself to me while I led my classmates through an AP Chemistry solutions set in high school. I had always been interested in science, which provides my innate curiosity with an outlet, but I had not expected to find fulfillment in teaching others. I discovered that I could satisfy my otherwise insatiable desire for growth by helping others grow in their understanding of themselves and the universe. I followed the subtle pulls of curiosity and growth to Northwestern University, where I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow.

### Scientific Research.
My [research](/research) focused on water-soluble nanoparticles, which may be used for medical imaging or biological sensing.

### Teaching and education.
Outside the lab, I was immersed in improving classrooms via scientific inquiry through the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning. This took many forms, such as completing and presenting a [Teaching-As-Research experiment](/teaching/teaching-as-research), or developing new curricula. I also worked with colleagues to design/conduct [teaching assistant training workshops](/teaching/training-gtas), advocate for evidenced-based changes to existing undergraduate curricula, and support a departmental commitment to pedagogy.

### Leadership and service.
I served my department and academic community by creating opportunities for growth and leading discussions with multiple stakeholders. I co-founded [Chemistry Graduate Student Teachers](/leadership), a graduate student group focused on science education and graduate student professional development, to build a space for learning how to teach within Northwestern's Chemistry Department. I was also the treasurer of the [Graduate Liaison Committee](/leadership), which brings together other student organizations, staff, and faculty to improve the graduate student experience in the Chemistry Department.

### Engagement and communication.
I am devoted to [making science accessible](/engagement) to everyone. This endeavor has manifested in a myriad of ways, including participating in amateur stand-up comedy through Science Riot presented by the Chicago Council of Science and Technology. I have also enjoyed teaching societyâ€™s youngest scientists through a variety of after school science education programs for local K-12 students.

### Looking for more?
I raised funds and cycled from Baltimore, MD to Seattle, WA with the [Ulman Foundation's](https://ulmanfoundation.org) [4K for Cancer](https://4kforcancer.org/) organization. My story starts with [this old blog post](http://schwabacher4k.blogspot.com/2011/12/why-i-am-riding-4k.html).
