title: The effects of temporal focus on students' motivation to learn science (Updated 2019)
date: 2019-05-23
abstract: Abstract: Student attitudes, particularly the motivation to learn, play a significant role in student achievement in STEM courses. The effects of the temporal focus of a discussion question were studied using pre- and post-intervention surveys. These experiments were completed over the course of two years. While most measured changes of motivation were insignificant, there was a significant (p < .005) increase in self-efficacy for individuals responding to the future-focused discussion problem. This work encourages further investigation of temporal focus within the STEM classroom
