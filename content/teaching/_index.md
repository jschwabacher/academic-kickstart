I view the relationship between teachers and students as one that is dynamic and focused on student growth. It is, at its best, responsive to the needs individual students. I am always seeking to use teaching practices that benefit different student populations and provide opportunities for students to learn from their mistakes and misunderstandings. These beliefs are thoroughly reflected in my teaching philosophy.

I have applied my training as a researcher to investigate best-practices through a teaching as research project.

I believe that one of the greatest ways to reach more students is to train better educators, which I have been involved in within my department.

Details regarding my education-related experiences and perspectives are available via the sidebar.
