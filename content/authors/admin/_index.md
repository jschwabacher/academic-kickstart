Hi, I'm a scientist and educator currently based in Chicago, IL.

My love of science education quietly revealed itself to me while I led my classmates through an AP Chemistry solutions set in high school. I had always been interested in science, which provides my innate curiosity with an outlet, but I had not expected to find fulfillment in teaching others. I discovered that I could satisfy my otherwise insatiable desire for growth by helping others grow in their understanding of themselves and the universe.

I've followed the subtle pulls of curiosity and growth to Northwestern University, where I am a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and PhD candidate.
